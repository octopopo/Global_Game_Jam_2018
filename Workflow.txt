1/27 Global Game Jam
1.setting up script for both player and star, basically what they do now is just adding tag to the object
2.Now I set up a game manager to handle thing between objects, now it can get the distance between stars and player
3.the coefficient for the star sound is the distance and divide by 10, it did fit the range of 0~1, but the effect should wait
