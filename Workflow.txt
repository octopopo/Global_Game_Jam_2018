1/27 Global Game Jam
1.setting up script for both player and star, basically what they do now is just adding tag to the object
2.Now I set up a game manager to handle thing between objects, now it can get the distance between stars and player
3.the coefficient for the star sound is the distance and divide by 10, it did fit the range of 0~1, but the effect should wait
4.for each star, it should contain a collider 2D and a Sprite Renderer, and a audio source (Maybe?)
5.instead of using button for each star, use raycast, BEWARE!!! Because we are doing a 2D game, so thing should be using 2D component, such as Raycast2D, Physic2D
6. In the GameManager, all reference of player and star are all dragged by developer, also the answer of this level are handcrafted by developer when they type it
